    <p>The word cocktail was not always a catch all term for mixed drinks like it is today.  In it's initial usage it was a specific category of mixed drinks.  A cocktail was a mixed drink with 4 main ingredients providing a framework bartenders have been building off of for centuries</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spirit</li>
      <li>Bitters</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Water</li>

    <p>All cocktails are stirred over ice before being strained into the glass.  All cocktails can be served either with or without ice depending on preference.  While most cocktails have a common default serving (the Old Fashioned over ice, the Martini up) that should be used unless otherwise specified, there are others, like the Negroni, that are not more commonly served one way or the other.</p>
    <p>When preparing your drink, pour all the liquid ingredients into your mixing glass.  A pint glass will work fine for one or maybe two drinks at a time, you just need a large thick glass with a strudy base.  Add enough ice to your liquid ingredients to fill the glass to the top, and stir with your barspoon (any long skinny stick will do).  Mixing the ingredients together is the least important thing happening here.  The heat from the room temperature liquids is being transferred to the frozen ice.  This drops the temperature of the drink, and also causes some of the ice to melt and dilute the drink.  If done perfectly this produces a refreshingly chilled drink with a minimized alcohol burn.  Underdo it and it will burn going down, overdo it and it will be a watery mess</p>
    <p>While stirring your drink, keep as little skin in contact with the class as possible.  The goal is to have as close to 100% of the ice melt to come from the ice absorbing heat from the liquid as possible, and to minimize any other heat sources such as skin.  It is usually best to only touch the glass near the top with 1 or 2 finger tips.  As the glass starts to get cold, dip a straw into the glass and pull some drink out to taste.  As long as your measurements were correct ingredient good then the drink should taste right.  Don't worry about tasting for flavor, just suck it into the back of your throat to feel alcohol burn and temperature.</p>
    <p>If your drink will be served up, taste the drink keeping in mind that the drink will not get any more diluted, only warmer after serving.  The drink should be very cold, and there should only be very little if any alcohol burn.  Strain the drink into a chilled glass, then garnish.</p>
    <p>If your drink will be served over ice, taste the drink keeping in mind that the drink won't get much warmer after you serve it, but it will get more diluted.  These should be served slightly "underdone", it's better they have a little bite to them at first than to be watery at the end.  Also keep in mind the ice being used.  Larger chunks of ice will melt slower than smaller pieces.</p>
